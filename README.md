  NEANDER is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by John von Neumann and others in the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. That document describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with these components: 
  - A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
  - A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter
  - Memory that stores data and instructions
  - External mass storage
  - Input and output mechanisms
